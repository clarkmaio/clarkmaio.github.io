It is a very nice comic.  Of course I use to watch the cartoon on MTV when I was a boy but now I am really into the books, and I am really fascinated by the whole story and the characters... but I don't want to talk about it.</p> <p>The only thing that matter is that it really motivated me to train in order to do a slam dunk: namely I am going to train to jump high.</p> <p>This will be a dynamic post which means that it will change during time. In fact I will report my improments of my training with few tables and plots.</p> <p>I hope this will help my ego and my self to not stop the training.</p>"}]}
