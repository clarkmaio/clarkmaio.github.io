It is a very nice comic. Of course I use to watch the cartoon on MTV when I was a boy but now I am really into the books, and I am really fascinated by the whole story and the characters... but I don't want to talk about it. The only thing that matter is that it really motivated me to train in order to do a slam dunk: namely I am going to train to jump high. This will be a dynamic post which means that it will change during time. In fact I will report my improments of my training with few tables and plots. I hope this will help my ego and my self to not stop the training.","title":"Dunk"},{"location":"blog/posts/dunk/#dunk","text":"So here the thing, in the last period I've started reading Slam Dunk.
