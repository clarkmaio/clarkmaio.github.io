# Dunk

So here the thing, in the last period I've started reading Slam Dunk. It is a very nice comic.
<br> Of course I use to watch the cartoon on MTV when I was a boy but now I am really into the books, and I am really fascinated by the whole story and the characters... but I don't want to talk about it.

The only thing that matter is that it really motivated me to train in order to do a slam dunk: namely I am going to train to jump high.

This will be a ***dynamic post*** which means that it will change during time. Infact I will report my improments of my training with few tables and plots.

I hope this will help my ego and my self to not stop the training.
