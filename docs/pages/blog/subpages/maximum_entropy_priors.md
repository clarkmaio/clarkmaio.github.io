# Maximum entropy priors
In this period I am studying a lot about Bayesian statistics.
The focus is of course on the applications, in particular using PyMC package on Python.

Ofcourse one of the most common question when studying Bayesian statistics is: **Which prior I am suppose to use?**
You want to inject as much info as possible, but usually you have very few information to inject.
